ASSIGNMENT 2 
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*This assignment will produce a command shell using C++. It will be called "rshell",
and it will involve many of the common commands found in bash and in the other
programming language: Shell Script. A list of known bugs will periodically be
added to this file as the development proceeds.
